# SecFog

SecFog helps application operators in determining secure deployments based on specific application security requirements, available infrastructure security capabilities, and considering trust degrees in different Edge and Cloud providers. 

SecFog is written in the [ProbLog2 language](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/index.html) and it can be used together with existing approaches (e.g., [FogTorchPi](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/FogTorchPI/tree/multithreaded)) that solve the problem of mapping IoT application services to Cloud-Edge infrastructures according to requirements other than security and trust.
